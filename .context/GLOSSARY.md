# StakTrakr — Domain Glossary

Precious metals portfolio tracker (vanilla JS PWA).

## Inventory & Items

**Item**:
A single inventory record representing one or more identical pieces of precious metal or currency. Identified by a UUID.
_Avoid_: lot, stack, piece, entry

**Serial**:
An auto-incrementing integer assigned to each Item for human-readable ordering.
_Avoid_: ID, index, sequence number

**Inline Chip**:
A compact metadata badge rendered inside inventory table cells showing key item attributes at a glance.
_Avoid_: tag chip, badge, pill

**Filter Chip**:
A clickable category toggle in the toolbar that narrows the inventory view by metal, type, or custom group.
_Avoid_: filter button, category filter

**Tag**:
A user-defined label attached to one or more Items for flexible categorization. Stored separately from the Item record in a UUID-keyed map.
_Avoid_: label, category

## Disposition & Lifecycle

**Acquisition**:
The event of an Item entering inventory — the dated purchase the detail modal charts as a marker, counts in the substrip, and lists in the Acquisitions ledger. The neutral event noun for user-facing copy (STRK-357); "Acquired <date>" is its tooltip form.
_Avoid_: buy, purchase (as the event noun — `buyCost`, `purchaseLocation`, and `dmRole: "buys"` are code identifiers, not copy)

**Disposition**:
The record of how an Item left active inventory — sold, traded, lost, or gifted. Tracks realized value and date.
_Avoid_: disposal, removal, exit

**Trade Link**:
A bidirectional reference between a disposed-traded Item and the Item(s) received in exchange. Uses `tradedForUuids`.
_Avoid_: trade reference, swap link

**Partial-Stack Disposition**:
Disposing of fewer than all units in a multi-quantity Item, splitting the original record into disposed and remaining portions.
_Avoid_: partial sale, split, partial disposal

**Change Log**:
A persistent, undoable history of every field-level modification to any Item. Stored in localStorage as a compressed array.
_Avoid_: audit log, edit history, activity log

## Market Data & Pricing

**Spot Price**:
The current per-troy-ounce market price for a tracked metal (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper — STRK-305), sourced from a configured Spot Provider.
_Avoid_: market price, live price, melt value

**Spot Provider**:
An external API source for spot prices. One of: `STAKTRAKR`, `METALS_DEV`, `METALS_API`, `METAL_PRICE_API`, `GOLD_API`, `CUSTOM`, or `MANUAL`. Configured in the `metalApiConfig` store.
_Avoid_: API source, price feed, data source

**Premium**:
The per-ounce price difference between what was paid for an Item and the spot price at time of purchase. Calculated as `(price / weight) - spotPrice`.
_Avoid_: markup, over-spot, spread

**Spot Bundle**:
Pre-built yearly JSON files (`data/spot-history-{year}.json`) that seed the Spot History on first load without requiring API calls.
_Avoid_: seed data, history bundle, bootstrap data

**Spot History**:
A time-series of hourly and daily spot prices stored in localStorage under `metalSpotHistory`. Used for charts and historical valuation.
_Avoid_: price history, historical prices

**Vendor**:
A retail dealer whose real-time coin/bar pricing is tracked by the retail pipeline. Identified by a slug.
_Avoid_: dealer, retailer, shop, seller

**Retail View**:
The modal showing live dealer prices, intraday charts, and 30-day history for a specific bullion product across multiple Vendors.
_Avoid_: market view, dealer view, price comparison

## Weight Units

**Weight Unit** (`weightUnit`):
A **display lens** over the canonical value in `item.weight`, not a statement about how the weight is stored. `oz`/`g`/`kg`/`lb`/`mg` all store **troy ounces** and convert outward for display; `gb`/`sb` store a Denomination; `cu` stores a Face Value. Sort keys and filter keys always use the canonical value, never the displayed text — which is why a cell and its filter chip can disagree unless the chip is explicitly mapped back (STRK-316, STRK-318, STRK-319).
_Avoid_: weight type, measurement unit

**Milligram** (`mg`):
Entry and display lens for sub-gram pieces — Aurum foil notes and similar are sold as 25 mg, 50 mg, where a gram figure is all leading zeros. Storage stays troy ounces like every other metric unit, so melt, totals, and sort need no special case (STRK-319).
_Avoid_: milligrams, mgs

**Adaptive Precision**:
Rendering a measured weight at its unit's normal decimal places, and adding decimals only when that precision would misrepresent the value. Fixed decimals assume one band of magnitude; this inventory spans a 25 mg note and a 100 ozt bar, so at two decimals 25 mg rendered `0.03 g` or `0.00 oz`. Ordinary weights are unaffected — `1.00 oz` and `31.65 g` are byte-identical (STRK-319).
_Avoid_: rounding, significant figures

## Goldback

**Goldback**:
A voluntary local currency note containing a measured amount of gold in a polymer bill. Priced by denomination (¼, ½, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 — see `GOLDBACK_DENOMINATIONS`) rather than by troy ounce. One Goldback is 0.001 troy oz of gold, so `item.weight` stores the **denomination**, not a weight; consumers that need a weight convert via `getUnitOztWeight`.
_Avoid_: gold note, gold bill

**Goldback Estimate**:
A calculated fair-market value for a Goldback denomination derived from the gold spot price, the Goldback-to-gold-gram rate (G1 rate), and an optional modifier.
_Avoid_: estimated price, calculated price

**AGW** (Actual Gold Weight):
The pure gold content of a piece in troy ounces — the gold counterpart to [ASW](#constitutional-silver). A ¼ Goldback carries 0.00025 ozt AGW, a 1 Goldback 0.001 ozt. Because Goldbacks are bought and quoted by denomination, the Weight cell shows the denomination (`¼ gb`) and the AGW is surfaced in that cell's tooltip; the Weight column still sorts on AGW so notes rank correctly against bullion (STRK-318).
_Avoid_: gold content, actual weight, derived oz

**Denomination**:
The face-unit of a Goldback or Silverback note — the value stored in `item.weight` for the `gb`/`sb` units. An exact enum value from `GOLDBACK_DENOMINATIONS` / `SILVERBACK_DENOMINATIONS`, never a measurement, so it must be rendered exactly and never rounded (rounding once turned a ¼ Goldback into `0.3 gb`). Sub-1 denominations display as fraction glyphs: `¼ gb`, `½ gb`.
_Avoid_: note value, face value (that term is Constitutional Silver's), weight

## Constitutional Silver

**Constitutional Silver**:
US circulating coinage valued for its silver content rather than as bullion — 90% issues struck through 1964, 35% war nickels (1942–1945), and 40% Kennedy halves (1965–1970). "Pre-1965" describes only the 90% issues. Uses the `cu` weight unit; `item.weight` stores a **face value** in dollars, not a weight.
_Avoid_ as the canonical noun: 90% silver, coin silver. ("Junk silver" is the common trade term and is fine as a one-time gloss in user-facing copy and code comments — it is what users search for — but Constitutional Silver is the canonical term for requirements, ACs, and issue text.)

**ASW** (Actual Silver Weight):
The pure silver content of a coin or lot in troy ounces, derived from its denomination and the worn/fresh basis. The standard numismatic term — junk-silver dealers quote and price bags in ASW, which is why it is the user-facing label on every surface showing this figure (STRK-299). Constitutional is silver-only in StakTrakr, so there is no gold counterpart (AGW) to disambiguate against.
_Avoid_: silver content, pure silver weight, derived oz

**Face Value** (suffix `fv`):
The legal-tender denomination of a Constitutional lot in US dollars — the figure junk silver is quoted and bought in. Stored in `item.weight`: face mode holds the entered **total** (qty is 1 by contract), denomination mode holds face-per-coin (total = weight × coin count). Rendered `$6.00 fv` in the Weight cell and card chips; the `fv` suffix is what stops it reading as another money column beside Purchase, Melt, and Retail. Never currency-converted — it stays in USD even when the display currency is EUR (STRK-300).
_Avoid_: face, $face, denomination value, legal tender value

**Valuation Basis**:
The global worn/fresh multiplier applied to every Constitutional Item's mint-spec silver weight. `worn` (default) reflects circulated wear; `fresh` uses uncirculated mint spec.
_Avoid_: wear factor, condition, grade

## Catalog & Enrichment

**Catalog Provider**:
An external numismatic database (Numista or PCGS) used to enrich Items with mintage data, images, composition, and grading. Configured in the `catalog_api_config` store.
_Avoid_: data provider, lookup service, enrichment API

**Numista Data**:
The nested object on an Item (`item.numistaData`) containing fields pulled from the Numista catalog — year range, composition, shape, images, and catalog ID.
_Avoid_: catalog data, coin data, enrichment data

**Numista ID**:
A Numista catalog **type** identifier (`item.numistaId`) — e.g. the N# for "American Silver Eagle". Identifies a coin design, NOT a physical copy: a user may own several distinct Item Instances under one Numista ID.
_Avoid_: coin id, catalog number (as an instance identifier)

**Item Instance**:
A single physical copy of a catalog type. Two Items are distinct instances when their Numista ID, issue year, grade, or certNumber differ (e.g. a 2023 vs 2024 coin, or a raw vs a PCGS-graded one). Identical ungraded copies of the same N#+year share an instance key; at **import time** the Numista importer collapses such repeated export rows into one Item with summed quantity (`DiffEngine.collapseByInstanceKey`). This is an import pre-processing step — existing inventory Items each keep their own UUID and are never silently merged.
_Avoid_: copy, unit, duplicate

**Item Identity Key**:
The stable string `computeItemKey()` derives to match Items across import, cloud sync, and changelog; it returns the **highest available tier**: `uuid` → `serial` → `numistaId|year|grade|certNumber` (the instance tier — year is `item.year`; grade/cert trimmed + lowercased, empty→`""`) → `name|date`. `computeItemKey` is authoritative in `diff-engine.js`; `changeLog.js` and `diff-modal.js` delegate to it. `enrichItemIdentities` does **not** re-run the full ladder — it backfills the stable `uuid` onto incoming rows (matching serial → instance-key FIFO bucket → name|date) and shares only the `_instanceKey` normalization. That UUID backfill is what keeps an Item's identity stable after it later gains a `numistaId`.
_Avoid_: item key, dedup key, hash

## Cloud & Storage

**Cloud Sync**:
The Dropbox-backed system that encrypts (AES-GCM), uploads, and restores complete inventory snapshots. Supports atomic rollback on restore failure.
_Avoid_: backup, Dropbox sync, cloud backup

**Dual Config Store**:
The architecture where spot provider keys live in `metalApiConfig` (via `loadApiConfig`/`saveApiConfig`) and catalog provider keys live in `catalog_api_config` (via `catalogConfig`). Confusing the two stores causes silent data loss.
_Avoid_: config store, API config

## App Infrastructure

**Feature Flag**:
A runtime toggle (`FeatureFlags` class) that gates experimental or beta functionality. Persisted in localStorage, overridable via URL parameters.
_Avoid_: feature toggle, experiment, beta flag

## Relationships

- An **Item** has zero or one **Disposition**. A Disposition makes the Item inactive.
- A **Disposition** of type "traded" may have one or more **Trade Links** to other Items.
- A **Partial-Stack Disposition** splits one **Item** into two: disposed and remaining.
- Each **Item** has zero or more **Tags**. Tags are stored in a separate UUID-keyed map.
- A **Spot Provider** feeds **Spot Prices** into the system. Only one provider is active at a time.
- A **Catalog Provider** enriches an **Item** with **Numista Data** (or PCGS data).
- The **Dual Config Store** separates **Spot Provider** credentials from **Catalog Provider** credentials.
- The **Change Log** records every field-level mutation on every **Item**.
- A **Numista ID** identifies a catalog type (spanning years); an **Item Instance** is `Numista ID + year + grade + certNumber`. The **Item Identity Key** encodes that instance identity in its tertiary tier.

## Flagged Ambiguities

- "vendor" vs "dealer" vs "retailer" — resolved: use **Vendor** in code and UI. "Dealer" acceptable in user-facing prose.
- "item" vs "lot" vs "stack" — resolved: use **Item** for the data record. "Stack" is colloquial for a user's collection; never use as a code term for a single record.
- "disposal" vs "disposition" — resolved: use **Disposition**. "Disposal" implies waste; disposition tracks realized value.
- `metalApiConfig` vs `catalog_api_config` — resolved: these are the **Dual Config Store**. Always use the correct accessor pair.
- `numistaId` as type vs instance — resolved: **Numista ID** is a catalog TYPE; physical-copy identity is the **Item Instance** (adds grade + certNumber). Keying dedup on Numista ID alone wrongly merges distinct graded instances (STRK-167).
